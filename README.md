# Web-scrapping-project
Simple web scrapping code using Python Selenium library and Python docx library to store text in a word document. This ode is just a Syntax to Copy text from website and make a word document from that text.
<br>
In this code I have used Selenium library to read the element from webpage as text. The URL of the webpage should be given in sixth line as string argument to get function. 
<br>
To find the CSSselector path of a selected part of webpage, Install "SelectorsHub" extension to chrome. when launched, click the hover icon , then select the desired element, it will give the Relative CSS selectors path and Xpath very easily. Copy the CSS selectrs path and paste in the argument of 'exist' fuction OR Copy the xpath and paste in the argument of 'existx' fuction. 
<br>
The webpage will be opened and closed automatically. To save the copied text , I have used 'docx' library. It will make a docx file and print the selected element text , and save the file with the given name.
<br>
You can make any Webscrapping project by giving conditions and paths to this code according to your need.
